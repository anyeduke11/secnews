"""Collector run/result models used by the collection layer.

Three models, all Pydantic v2:

- ``SourceResult``     per-source outcome (one entry per configured source)
- ``CollectionResult`` per-category outcome (one per ``Category``)
- ``CollectionReport`` whole-run aggregate (one per ``run_once()`` call)

Plus Phase 3.5 quality-gate models:

- ``GateResult``       per-gate outcome (one per ``BaseGate.check()``)
- ``PipelineResult``   aggregate of all gates that ran for a single item

Datetime convention: all ``datetime`` fields MUST be tz-aware UTC
(``datetime.now(timezone.utc)``). This matches the convention in
``backend.domain.models`` and is enforced there by a validator; the
models here are passed-in values, so callers are expected to construct
them with aware datetimes.
